1. How are ratings distributed? Don't forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
They are distributed mostly between slightly above 2 and 4 with 5 outliers. One outlier at 5, one outlier at 1 and the rest near 2. 
```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbchu/ds202_labs/master/choco.csv")
boxplot(choco$Rating)
```

2. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar? 

No, there appears to be very little correlation. 

```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct,choco$Rating, xlab = "Rating",ylab = "Cocao Percent",main = "Cocao percent compared to Rating")
cor(choco$Cocoa.Pct,choco$Rating)
```

3. What class is the variable representing company locations? How is this different from a 'character' variable? (You do not need to produce a graphic for this question.)
It's a factor. It's different because factors have levels and defined values, whereas characters can be anything.
